Hi, I’m Connor Schutze @ConnorSchutze

# About Me
I’m a passionate software engineer focused on building efficient, scalable, and cross-platform solutions. My background spans RESTful API development, backend systems, and cloud-native applications. I have a strong interest in algorithms and mathematics, which fuels my curiosity for performance optimization and elegant design.

If you're looking for a backend developer with a strong understanding of systems design, cloud architecture, and algorithmic thinking—I'd love to connect.

# Projects
## Cloud-Based Algorithmic Trading Strategies  
Together with my team, I’m developing a cloud-hosted algorithmic trading service. This project aims to democratize access to algorithmic trading by allowing developers to fine-tune and deploy trading strategies, while giving investors real-time visibility into algorithmic decisions.

## Tarpaulin
Utilizing Google Clouds services and SQL, I developed a learning mangagement system. My system was web based and provided abilities to create coureses, employ faculty, and store attributes related to students. The design was REST based and required constant testing using Postman.

## Stemleaf
Programmed and deployed a full-stack web application supporting 5000+ users and staff and 100 courses with persistent user enrollment tracking. Engineered a normalized SQL schema. Implemented CRUD functionality with access control.
